# 06 – Modularization in ABAP

Modularization helps to break a program into small reusable units.
It improves readability, testing, and maintainability.

## 🚀 Concepts Covered

- FORM...ENDFORM (subroutines)
- PERFORM usage
- Passing parameters
- Table processing in subroutines
- Function modules – when to use them
- METHODS vs FORMS – basic difference

## 🧩 Try it yourself

1. Create a FORM that prints 'Hello with FORM'.
2. Pass two numbers to a FORM and print their sum.
3. Create a FORM that loops an internal table and prints only odd numbers.
4. Convert a FORM into a METHOD inside a local class.
5. Create a function module in SE37 (just describe steps).
