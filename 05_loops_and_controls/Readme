## 🧩 Try it yourself

1. Write a DO loop from 1–10 and print only odd numbers.
2. Convert a WHILE loop into a DO loop.
3. Using LOOP AT, print only entries where value > 100.
4. Use CASE statement for day = 'MON', 'TUE', 'WED'.
5. Break a loop when value = 5 using EXIT.
6. Skip printing value = 3 using CONTINUE.
